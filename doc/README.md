## Why should you care?
__InEngine.NET__ is a set of .NET packages that allow for the creation of a code-centric data integration and asynchronous job scheduling server.
Integration jobs are created in code, making them flexible and testable.

Existing commercial data integration server products do not work in a way software developers are comfortable with.
They provide a drag-and-drop GUI application for implementing a data integration.
This sounds appealing, but such GUIs are often clunky and slow.
Additionally, such products do not provide a testable way to build integrations and detect why they stop functioning.
This is a serious issue as data integrations are fragile by nature.

In contrast, a developer would prefer fine-grained, programmatic access to the data they are querying, transforming, and persisting.
A developer would also like to be able to test their integrations to ensure their continued operation. 
__InEngine.NET__ allows this.
